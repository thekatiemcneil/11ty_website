# Hi there!

## I'm Katie McNeil, a software engineer & product manager based in Austin, Texas.  



I've been at [Senseye](https://www.senseye.co) for the last few years, moving from intern to software engineer to my current position as technical product manager.  

I grew up on an island in the Pacific Northwest, have spent time in over thirty countries, and am an avid follower of women's soccer.
