# Hi there!

## I'm Katie McNeil, a software engineer based in Austin, Texas.  



I currently work at [Homeward](https://www.homeward.com) as a frontend engineer. Before that, I was at [Senseye](https://www.senseye.co) as a software engineer and technical product manager.

I grew up on an island in the Pacific Northwest, have spent time in over thirty countries, and am an avid follower of women's soccer.
