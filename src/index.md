# Hi there!

## I'm Katie McNeil, a software engineer based in Austin, Texas.  



I currently work at [Homeward](https://www.homeward.com) as a frontend engineer. Before that, I was at [Senseye](https://www.senseye.co) as a software engineer and technical product manager.

I grew up on an island in the Pacific Northwest, have spent time in over thirty countries, and am an avid follower of women's soccer. In the pre-covid world, I was a regular at concerts, coffee shops, and craft breweries. These days, I get my [live music fix](https://youtu.be/OGmIVMCqwiE?t=3005) on youtube and brew at home with an [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/).

You can learn more about me by checking out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thekatiemcneil), [Github](https://www.github.com/thekatiemcneil), or by [emailing me](mailto:thekatiemcneil@gmail.com).
