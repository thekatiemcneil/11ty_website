# Hi there!

## I'm Katie McNeil, a software engineer.  


I'm currently on a sabbatical until mid-2026. My previous experience includes [Cofactr](https://www.cofactr.com) (director of frontend engineering), [Homeward](https://www.homeward.com) (frontend engineer), and [Senseye](https://www.senseye.co) (software engineer, technical product manager).

I grew up on an island in the Pacific Northwest, have spent time in over thirty countries, and am an avid follower of women's soccer.

You can learn more about me by checking out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thekatiemcneil), [Github](https://www.github.com/thekatiemcneil), or by [emailing me](mailto:thekatiemcneil@gmail.com).
